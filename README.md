This repository demonstrates a common issue in React Router Dom v6 where navigating to an invalid route results in unexpected behavior (blank screen or incorrect component rendering). The `bug.js` file shows the erroneous implementation, while `bugSolution.js` provides the corrected version, demonstrating best practices for handling invalid routes.  This is usually due to missing route definitions or incorrect usage of the `useNavigate` hook.
